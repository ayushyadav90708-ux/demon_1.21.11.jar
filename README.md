## ⬇️ Download

[![Download latest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-latest%20.jar-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Nevarielle/baritone-1.21.11/releases/latest)

Get the jar from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/Nevarielle/baritone-1.21.11/releases/latest)**, drop `baritone-fabric-1.21.11.jar` into your Minecraft **1.21.11** Fabric `mods/` folder, launch, then type `#goto 1000 500` in chat.

## What this fork is

The goal was simply to get Baritone running on Minecraft 1.21.11 with Fabric.

**Working:**
- Builds a Fabric jar (`fabric/build/libs/baritone-fabric-1.9.5.jar`).
- Verified in-game: `#goto`, `#explore`, `#mine`, `#tunnel` work and the path renders correctly.

**Known limitations** (see [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for details):
- Path/goal is **not drawn through walls** yet (depth test is baked into the new render pipeline).
- The **goal beacon beam** is disabled — the goal is shown as a box instead.
- Movement input while a screen is open needs a different hook (`Screen.passEvents` was removed).
- ProGuard / obfuscated distribution build is untested.

This is a work-in-progress port, not a polished release.

---

## Build from source

Requires a **JDK 21**.

```bash
# set JAVA_HOME to your JDK 21, then:
./gradlew :fabric:remapJar          # Linux / macOS / Git Bash
gradlew.bat :fabric:remapJar        # Windows CMD / PowerShell
```

The finished jar lands in `fabric/build/libs/`. Drop it into your Fabric `mods` folder.

## Usage

Same chat commands as upstream Baritone:

- `#goto 1000 500` — walk to x=1000 z=500
- `#mine diamond_ore` — mine diamond ore
- `#tunnel` — dig a tunnel in the direction you're facing
- `#stop` — stop
